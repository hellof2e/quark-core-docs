    "The component library can exist without relying on the technical framework.",

    "Benefiting from the native support of web components in browsers, we developed Quark Design using this technology.",

    "The built components do not need to rely on third-party runtimes, and the average volume of each component is about 1kb ~ 2kb.",

    "Relying on Web components technology, quarkd can be used by any front-end framework.",
  box3Title: "Stable version",
  box3Desc:
    "Unlike other third-party component libraries, quarkd will not update and iterate with the upgrade of the technology stack. It does not need to be updated all year round, and there is no historical burden.",
  whatDesc1:
    "Quarkd is a brand new way of building components. Traditional component frameworks such as Antd and Vant need to do a lot of work in the browser, but Quark puts these tasks into the compilation phase of building applications.",
  whatDesc2:
    "The data modification of the component is handled by the browser's own API, which is simpler and more efficient!",
